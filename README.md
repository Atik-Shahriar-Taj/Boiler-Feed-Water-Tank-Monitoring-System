# Boiler-Feed-Water-Tank-Monitoring-System

Introduction:
This project simulates and monitors a Boiler Feed Water Tank. It provides real-time monitoring of critical parameters like water level, temperature, and flow rate. Alerts are generated for unsafe conditions, and the data is logged for analysis. Additionally, the system visualizes these parameters through real-time graphs.

Features:
1. Real-time monitoring of water level, temperature, and flow rate.
2. Alerts for unsafe conditions such as low water level or high temperature.
3. Data logging to a CSV file.
4. Real-time visualization using graphs.

Instructions:
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install matplotlib
2. Save the Python code to a file (e.g., boiler_tank_monitoring.py).
3. Run the script in a Python environment.
4. The monitoring system starts, and real-time graphs display the parameters.
5. Data is logged to a file named boiler_tank_data.csv.
